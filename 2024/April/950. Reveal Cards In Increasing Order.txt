Sort the deck in increasing order.
Initialize an empty list to store the final ordering of the deck (result).
Iterate through each card in the sorted deck:
    If result is not empty:
        Move the last card to the front of the result list.
    Insert the current card at the bottom of the result list.
Return the result list, which contains the ordering that reveals the cards in increasing order.
