function numRescueBoats(people: List[int], limit: int) -> int:
    Sort the array 'people' in non-decreasing order
    Initialize two pointers 'left' and 'right' to the beginning and end of the array respectively
    Initialize 'boats' to 0 (this will count the number of boats needed)
    
    while left <= right:
        if people[left] + people[right] <= limit:
            Increment 'left' by 1

            Decrement 'right' by 1
        
        Increment 'boats' by 1
