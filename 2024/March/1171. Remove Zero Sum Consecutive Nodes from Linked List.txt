Function removeZeroSumSublists(head):
    Create a dummy node and point it to the head of the linked list
    Initialize a hashmap to store cumulative sums and their corresponding nodes
    Set the initial cumulative sum to 0
    
    Loop through the linked list while head is not None:
        Update the cumulative sum by adding the value of the current node to it
        
        If the current sum exists in the hashmap:
            Traverse back from the previous occurrence of the same sum up to the current occurrence
            Remove nodes between these occurrences
            Adjust the pointers to skip nodes with zero sum
        Else:
            Store the current sum and its corresponding node in the hashmap
        
        Move to the next node
        
    Return the next node of the dummy node as the head of the final linked list
