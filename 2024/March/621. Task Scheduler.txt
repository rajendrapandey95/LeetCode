Define a function leastInterval(tasks: List[str], n: int) -> int:
    Initialize a dictionary or counter to count the frequency of each task.
    Iterate through the tasks and count the frequency of each task.
    Find the maximum frequency of any task.
    Count the number of tasks with the maximum frequency.
    Calculate the minimum intervals required:
        For each repetition of the most frequent task, we need (max_count - 1) intervals.
        Each interval has (n + 1) slots.
        Add the number of tasks with the maximum frequency to the calculated intervals.
    The minimum intervals required should be at least the length of the tasks array.
    Return the maximum of the length of the tasks array and the calculated minimum intervals.
