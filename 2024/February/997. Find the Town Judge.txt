Function findJudge(n, trust):
    Initialize arrays trust_count and trusted_count with all elements set to 0
    
    Iterate through the trust array:
        For each pair (a, b) in trust:
            Increment trust_count[a]
            Increment trusted_count[b]
    
    Iterate through the range from 1 to n:
        If trust_count[i] equals 0 and trusted_count[i] equals n - 1:
            Return i (this is the town judge)
    
    If no town judge is found:
        Return -1
